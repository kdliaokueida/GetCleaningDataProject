### Variable Description

* This codebood refers to the dataset.txt
  
The first two columns are the number of subject and the activity the operate
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following columns are like descripted in the features_info.txt, except that they are the average for each subject and each activity:

There are signals used to estimate variables of features vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): the average of mean value for each subject and each activity.
std(): the average of standard deviation for each subject and each activity.
